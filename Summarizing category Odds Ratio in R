## If the numbers of cases and controls are available, e.g. paper NO.4 
  The prerequisites are: 1) there are at least three dose categories; 2) one category serving as referent;
```{r}
## Calculate the overall OR for paper NO.4.
library(readr)
No_4_categorized <- read_csv("No_4_categorized.csv")                  # import data of paper No.4               
# the names for columns are given the same as the parameters in the "dosresmeta" function for convenience.

require(dosresmeta)
dr_4 <- dosresmeta(formula = logor~dose, type = "cc", cases = cases, 
                   n = n, lb = lb, ub = ub,data = No_4_categorized)    # applied generalized least square to estimate the trend

summary(dr_4)                                                          # give a summary of the results
predict(dr_4, delta = 10ï¼Œexpo = TRUE )                                
# based on the results, estimate a OR for every "delta" unit increase, "expo = TRUE" will return the OR instead of logOR.
